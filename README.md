A desktop app that transcribes and translates any audio playing on your PC in real time and shows the result as an overlay of subtitles. Audio and text are processed locally on your device — no API key is needed, and no audio or text is sent to an external service.

**Built with PLaMo.** Translation uses Preferred Networks' [PLaMo 3 Translate](https://huggingface.co/pfnet/plamo-3-translate-0.8b-GGUF).

> The builds are **not signed with an Apple Developer ID or a Windows code-signing certificate, and not notarized** (the macOS app is ad-hoc signed only), so SmartScreen / Gatekeeper warn on first launch. That does not mean the app is unsafe. See [Warnings](https://sp-yduck.github.io/overlaysubs/en/#warning) on the site, and never disable Gatekeeper or SmartScreen system-wide.

## Requirements

| | Windows | macOS |
|---|---|---|
| OS | Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit) | macOS 13 Ventura or later |
| CPU | x64 (Intel / AMD) | Apple Silicon (M1 or later) |
| GPU | **Vulkan-capable GPU with an up-to-date driver** | Integrated GPU (Metal) |
| Memory | 8 GB or more | 8 GB or more |
| Free disk space | Model download size (see [Models and tiers](#models-and-tiers)) | Same |

- Windows builds require a **Vulkan-capable GPU and current driver** (the official build uses `--features vulkan`). With an old driver the GPU is not used and performance is not usable in real time.
- There is no Intel Mac build, no 32-bit Windows build, and no Windows on ARM build.
- The only supported distribution channel is **GitHub Releases**; there is no auto-updater. The app only notifies you when a newer release exists and links to its release page.

## Architecture

```
WASAPI loopback (Windows) / ScreenCaptureKit system audio (macOS) / microphone ─▶ 16 kHz mono ─▶ Silero VAD endpointer ─▶ whisper.cpp ─▶ PLaMo 3 Translate (llama.cpp) ─▶ overlay
```

- `crates/core` holds engine-independent logic: tier selection, model definitions, PFML3 prompts, utterance segmentation, sessions, sentence-level translation, and SRT export. Run `cargo test -p overlaysubs-core`.
- `src-tauri` is the Tauri app: audio capture, whisper.cpp / llama.cpp adapters, model downloads, tray, hotkeys, and settings persistence.
- `ui` is the settings window and overlay: plain HTML/JS/CSS with no build step; `ui/i18n.js` holds the Japanese, English and Chinese (Traditional and Simplified) strings.
- The ASR and translation engines sit behind the `session::Asr` / `session::Translator` traits and can be swapped.
- `models.json` defines the models (URL, size, SHA-256, tier). URLs are pinned to Hugging Face commits (using `main` would break the hash when upstream re-uploads). Placing a `models.json` in the config folder overrides the bundled one without an app update.
- `licenses/` ships the OverlaySubs Terms of Use (Japanese and English); `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` lists the bundled libraries' licenses. The PLaMo 3 license is not bundled; the app and docs link to the official page instead.

## Features

- First run asks you to accept the OverlaySubs Terms of Use. Acceptance is stored in `terms-accepted` and not asked again until the terms version changes. "Check this PC" in the settings window detects your hardware and picks a tier (High / Mid / Low / CPU). The result is cached in `hardware.json`, so later launches show it without probing again; "Check again" re-runs the check.
- Models download from Hugging Face automatically, resume after interruption, and are verified with SHA-256. No account or token required.
- You can run the optional speed check (benchmark); if it cannot keep up in real time, it switches to one tier lower.
- Audio input is system audio or a microphone. Windows captures system audio with WASAPI loopback; on macOS 13+ system audio is captured directly with ScreenCaptureKit, so no loopback / virtual-audio device (such as BlackHole) is needed. The microphone works on both platforms. The first time you use system audio on macOS, allow OverlaySubs under System Settings → Privacy & Security → "Screen & System Audio Recording" (macOS 15+) or "Screen Recording" (macOS 13–14), then restart the app.
- Source language auto-detect or fixed. You can pick the target language and the "if already in that language" language, so English↔Japanese and Korean↔Japanese work together.
- Previous utterances are passed as context and translation happens per sentence. Glossary, a free-text topic hint, and Japanese plain/polite style are configurable.
- Partial results are dimmed; final translations stream in and replace them.
- Always-on-top, semi-transparent overlay (click-through can be enabled in settings). Original text, font size, font, background opacity, line count, display time, and the "Built with PLaMo" credit are configurable. The overlay appears while translating and hides when translation stops; you can also toggle it from "Show subtitles" in the tray menu or with the switch above the Start button. While translation is stopped, opening "Subtitles" shows the overlay with a sample caption so you can tune the appearance live.
- Export history as text or SRT.
- Tray/menu-bar resident, global hotkey (default `CmdOrCtrl+Shift+T`; `Ctrl+Shift+T` on Windows, `Cmd+Shift+T` on macOS) to start/stop. UI in Japanese, English and Chinese (Traditional and Simplified); the first launch picks one from the OS language settings, and falls back to English. The Terms of Use exist only in Japanese and English, so the Chinese UI shows the English version.
- At startup the app makes one anonymous request to the GitHub Releases API to check for a newer version; if there is one, a dismissible banner in the settings window shows the latest and current version with "Open release page" and "Later" buttons. Nothing is downloaded or installed automatically, and if the check fails (offline, API error) nothing is shown. Dismissing the banner lasts until the app restarts.
- Audio, transcripts, and translations are never sent anywhere. No telemetry. The only network access is the model download and one anonymous GitHub API request at startup to check for a newer release (it sends no account, token, or personal data; if it fails, nothing happens). The app works offline once the models are downloaded.

## Models and tiers

The tier is decided when you run "Check this PC" in first-run setup, and the models for that tier are selected automatically. The settings window lets you change the individual Whisper / PLaMo / VAD models. The detection result is cached; run "Check again" after changing the hardware, such as a new GPU.

| Tier | Detected when | Whisper | PLaMo 3 Translate | First download |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| High | VRAM 12 GB+ / Apple Silicon RAM 32 GB+ | large-v3-turbo | 8B Q4_K_M | ~6.9 GB |
| Mid | VRAM 8 GB / Apple Silicon RAM 16 GB | large-v3-turbo Q5_0 | 2B Q4_K_M | ~2.4 GB |
| Low | VRAM 4–6 GB / Apple Silicon RAM 8 GB | small | 2B Q4_K_M | ~2.3 GB |
| CPU | No GPU, or VRAM under 4 GB | base | 0.8B Q4_K_M | ~0.7 GB |

- Sizes are the sum of the declared sizes in `models.json` (including the ~0.9 MB Silero VAD). Allow about 10 GB free for High, 5 GB for Mid/Low, and 2 GB for CPU.
- Mid uses 2B instead of 8B because keeping Whisper and 8B Q4_K_M (5.3 GB) together in 8 GB of VRAM leaves no headroom for gaming. You can switch to 8B Q3_K_M or 31B manually in the settings window.
- The benchmark is optional. If you run it and the machine cannot keep up in real time, it suggests one tier lower and can switch to it.

## Build

Prerequisites: Rust stable (edition 2021). On Windows, MSVC + Windows SDK, CMake, LLVM / libclang (for bindgen), the Vulkan SDK, and WebView2. On macOS, Xcode 26 or Command Line Tools with the macOS 26 SDK: the ScreenCaptureKit bindings compile a small Swift bridge at build time, and the Metal dependency they link needs the macOS 26 SDK. Source builds need a Swift toolchain. Release CI selects the preinstalled Xcode 26 on the `macos-15` runner. Node.js is only needed to run the Tauri CLI through `npx` (not for the app itself).

```bash
# Windows (Vulkan, same as the official build)
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@2.12.4 build --features vulkan

# macOS (Metal)
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@2.12.4 build --features metal

# NVIDIA
npx --yes @tauri-apps/cli@2.12.4 build --features cuda
```

You can also `cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2" --locked` and use `cargo tauri build`. CI uses the prebuilt `npx @tauri-apps/cli@2.12.4` because `cargo install tauri-cli` took up to 19 minutes.

whisper.cpp and llama.cpp both embed ggml, so statically linking both into one process clashes on symbols. llama.cpp is therefore linked as a shared library (`dynamic-link` in `llama-cpp-2`) and shipped inside the installer.

- Windows: `src-tauri/libs/*.dll` is bundled via `bundle.resources`. `src-tauri/libs/` is gitignored, so before bundling copy llama.cpp's build output (`target/release/build/llama-cpp-sys-2-*/out/bin/*.dll`) into `src-tauri/libs/`. The CI steps are in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
- macOS: `beforeBundleCommand` runs `scripts/stage-dylibs.sh`, which collects the dylibs into `target/frameworks`; `bundle.macOS.files` ships them in `Frameworks`.
- `THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` is bundled too (see `src-tauri/tauri.windows.conf.json` and `tauri.macos.conf.json`).
- macOS: `src-tauri/Info.plist` is merged into the bundle's generated Info.plist (`bundle.macOS.infoPlist`). It declares the microphone and screen/system-audio usage strings (`NSMicrophoneUsageDescription` / `NSScreenCaptureUsageDescription`).

## Tests

The network-free core tests run in CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) on pull requests.

```bash
cargo test -p overlaysubs-core   # tiers, model registry, PFML3, endpointer, session, SRT
cargo test -p overlaysubs        # src-tauri unit tests
```

The end-to-end test with real models is `#[ignore]`d by default (it needs a 16 kHz mono WAV and downloads ~0.7 GB of models).

```bash
OVERLAYSUBS_WAV=path/to/16k-mono.wav cargo test -p overlaysubs -- --ignored
```

Pushing a `v*` tag makes the release workflow build the bundles and publish them to GitHub Releases; see [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md).
